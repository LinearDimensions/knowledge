## about me
Currently a Y3 Business and Computing student at NTU, I am fortunate to have equipped a wide range of skills for various career paths, be it for tech or consultancy or analytics roles. Perhaps it is this paradox of choice that makes me question what I truly want in life. This brought me to the concept of Ikigai which simply put explains the purpose in life arises from the intersection of 4 aspects: what you love, what the world needs, what you can be paid for and what you are good at. 
## corporate is not for me
Being in my 20s, I do not wish to commit my life into the corporate rat race, where I will not have full autonomy over what I do, which very often leads to burnout mid-career. Climbing the corporate ladder and handling work dynamics are just some everyday distractions from what the world really needs. Self-employment on the other hand allows greater flexibility in who I choose to work with, how much effort to put in, and me to be directly involved in value creation.

Next, the generalist vs specialist debate plays a significant part too. While specialists benefit from proficiency in their niche skillsets, they are less adaptable to changing landscape. I therefore strive to be a specialized generalists (a.k.a. T-shaped Creatives) who complements deep specialty with cross-functional and interpersonal soft skills in order to ensure a long-lasting career.
## what i love and specialise in
INVESTMENTS!! an overhyped yet complicated subject that has me obsessed. With many self-proclaimed gurus online promoting their own methods, I've always been skeptical and wanted to really understand how the economy and financial systems work. Having opportunities to interact with AIA Financial Consultants and WorldQuant researchers provided me eye-opening perspective into the vast world of investments, which I aim to educate more people about.
## why financial advisory
Ultimately, I enjoy talking to people and going beyond just surface conversations. I believe that what makes a happy life is the number and quality of close relationships that are maintained throughout one's lifetime. While the Dunbar's number suggests a cognitive limit to number of stable social relationships, the quality of relationship all the more matters to me.

Joining the AWM team has been awesome, their dedication to quality and comprehensive financial advisory as well as continuous education and servicing is essential to relationships building over a lifetime, something which aligns with my purpose.

Definitely, this is not without struggles. Personally, I did hear stories of people with negative experience and have preconceived stereotypes, which took me sometime to get over. Fundamentally, I am confident in the value I can bring that is not just selling products, but rather talking to people in a way that makes them feel comfortable to share their situations, and determining if and how the problem can be solved. There is nothing to be ashamed of as a quality FA is a professional who knows in and outs of different strategies and goes above and beyond in client servicing.

These have made me more dedicated on spreading good advisory practices and building healthy relationships with people around me.
