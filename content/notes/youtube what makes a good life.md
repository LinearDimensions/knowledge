summary: *quality relationships are essential to good life*

Based on Harvard Study of Adult Development:
- Good relationships keeps us healthier and happier: stay connected to family, friends and community 
- Quality of close relationships that matters: conflicts and emotional pain exacerbate physical pain
- Good close relationships protect our brain: sharper memory when people feel they can count on the other person in times of need
- Relationships are messy and maintaining them is arduous and lifelong: actively replace workmates with playmates, replace screentime with people time, livening up stale relationship with new experiences, long walks, reaching out
